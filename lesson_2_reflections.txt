1. What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

-A hidden .git folder is added to the directory. The
Folder contains the necessary files for Git to interact
with your repository. It gives you the functionality 
of the version-control system.

2.How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think 
it offers?

-The staging area is not permanent and allows you the 
opportunity to choose which files will be relevant to 
each commit. It also provides some safety by giving you
time to preview and second-check a commit before it is 
made.
