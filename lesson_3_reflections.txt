When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-When working on a project that is collaborative, it would be better to create a remote repository so everyone working on the project has easy access to it. Also, a remote repository will save data in the cloud, meaning the project you are working will be safe if something happens to corrupt or delete data on your local machine. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Sometimes you may realize a change you made on GitHub isn't one you want effecting your local
project. It's better to have more oversight and control over your code so that it can be updated
only with the changes that you really intend to make. Also, if you're working on a project with 
a group; it's better to view and discuss the commits they make to the code before adding them to 
your local project. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-Forks, clones and branchas all act upon a respository, but each has a different purpose. A clone copies
a respository from github to your local machine. That clone then becomes unique on your machine, and any
changes made locally stay local unless commited via git. A branch is a seperate version of your code. A
branch can be used for experimentation or for seperating code between collaborators. Branches can be merged
if the changes made to them are deemed appropriate for the actual project. Lastly, forks are seperate versions
from a single repository. It's simliar to a clone, but the original author of the code will be notified when
a new fork is made.
