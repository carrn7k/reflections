When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-When working on a project that is collaborative, it would be better to create a remote repository so everyone working on the project has easy access to it. Also, a remote repository will save data in the cloud, meaning the project you are working will be safe if something happens to corrupt or delete data on your local machine. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Sometimes you may realize a change you made on GitHub isn't one you want effecting your local
project. It's better to have more oversight and control over your code so that it can be updated
only with the changes that you really intend to make. Also, if you're working on a project with 
a group; it's better to view and discuss the commits they make to the code before adding them to 
your local project.
